ðŸ“Š [Download the Excel dataset](./customer16.xlsx)
I used Microsoft Excel for data cleansing and preprocessing. The dataset I worked with was the Customer Personality Analysis dataset collected from Kaggle. During the preprocessing steps, I first removed all duplicate records. Then, I handled missing values by filling the empty cells with "NA". I standardized the text values by unifying inconsistent entries â€” for example, I converted "2n Cycle" to "Master", "Graduation" to "Bachelor", and "Basic" to "Primary". Similarly, I standardized relationship statuses by converting "Together" to "In Relationship", "Alone" and "YOLO" to "Single". I also formatted all date values into the "dd-mm-yyyy" format. Additionally, I converted all column headers to lowercase and removed any spaces for consistency. Finally, I reviewed and corrected the data types to ensure they matched the nature of the data.
